		<h4>
		<p>Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br> 
		In the forests of the night,<br> 
		What immortal hand or eye<br> 
		Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br></p> 

		<p>In what distant deeps or skies<br> 
		Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br> 
		On what wings dare he aspire?<br> 
		What the hand dare seize the fire?<br></p> 

		<p>And what shoulder and what art<br> 
		Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br> 
		And when thy heart began to beat,<br> 
		What dread hand and what dread feet?<br></p>

		<p>What the hammer? what the chain?<br> 
		In what furnace was thy brain?<br> 
		What the anvil? What dread grasp<br> 
		Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br></p> 

		<p>When the stars threw down their spears,<br> 
		And water'd heaven with their tears,<br> 
		Did He smile His work to see?<br> 
		Did He who made the lamb make thee?<br></p> 

		<p>Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br> 
		In the forests of the night,<br> 
		What immortal hand or eye<br> 
		Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?<br></p>
